# Test Case Document #

## broken_link_or_image ##

This [line][] contains exactly 1 [broken](b r o k e n) \[link\]\(link\), and
this line has 0 `[broken](l i n k s)`.

  [line]: https://localhost/line

The following lines of text contain 0 because they are code blocks:

 ~~~
 There are no [broken](definitely not broken) links here...
 ~~~

   ```
  And there are no [broken](totally not broken) links here.
   ```

    There are also no [broken](nope still not broken) links here!

## empty_list_entry ##

The following list includes an empty item:

1. One
2.
3. Three

## heading_discontinuity ##

When adding a heading, the level of the new heading should be less than or
equal to the previous heading, or the new level should be exactly 1 greater:

> ### Good Heading ###
>
> ### Another Good Heading ###
>
> ##### Bad Heading; (5 - 3) ≠ 1 #####

The level of the first heading in a container sets the floor for all of the
following heading:

> #### First Heading In Block Quote ####
>
> #### Second Heading ####
>
> ### Bad Heading; Level 3 < Level 4 ###

## label_exists_for_destination ##

This [link](//#label_exists_for_destination) could be replaced with a label
i.e. [link][label_exists_for_destination].

  [label_exists_for_destination]: //#label_exists_for_destination

## link_destination_duplicate ##

The destinations for [localhost][] and [::1][] are the same.

  [localhost]: http://localhost/
  [::1]: http://localhost/

## link_label_defined_before_first_reference ##

  [localhost-tls]: https://127.0.0.1/

The label for [localhost-tls][] is defined above this line where it is first
referenced.

## link_label_duplicate ##

Two link reference definitions should never use the same
[label][link-label-duplicate].

  [link-label-duplicate]: https://localhost/link_label_duplicate
  [link-label-duplicate]: https://localhost/test-case-document

## link_label_unused ##

This link label is never referenced:

  [never-referenced]: //

When the unreferenced label is re-used, it should trigger link_label_duplicate
instead of link_label_unused:

  [never-referenced]: //#

## link_reference_definitions_out_of_order ##

- First: [Twinkle][] twinkle, little [star][]; how I [wonder][] what you are.
- If there is a series of link reference definitions after a list, the
  "sourcepos" attribute for the list will span the reference lines. Use of a
  list here ensures that the code path responsible for keeping
  "xml_line_elements" pruned is exercised.

  [star]: //star
  [twinkle]: //twinkle
  [wonder]: //wonder

## list_items_out_of_order ##

These numbers are not sequential:

1. One
2. Two
4. Four?!

These numbers are still not sequential:

> 1. One
> 2. Two
> 4. Four?!

These numbers are fine:

> > 1. One
> > 2. Two
> > 3. Three

## list_style_changed ##

The list marker changes in the middle of this unordered list:

- Apple
- Bear
- Cat
* Qbt
* Rntyr
* Sna

The number delimiter changes in the middle of this ordered list:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three
4) Four
5) Five
6) Six

This list changes from a tight list to a loose list:

- Ichi
- Nichi
- San
* Ein

* Zwei

* Drei

## missing_blank_line_before_loose_list ##

There is no blank line between this text and following loose list:
- Uno

- Dos

- Tres

## nested_heading ##

Headings generally only make sense as descendents of certain block elements. In
the following example, an empty list element results in a heading being created
in the middle of a list:

- Rosales
  - Rosaceae
    - Malus
      -
      - Pumila

## tight_list_adjacent_to_loose_list ##

Here is a tight list adjacent to a loose list:

- Alpha
- Bravo
- Charlie

* Delta

* Echo

* Foxtrot

## undefined_link_label ##

This line has 1 [broken][] link.

This line also has 1 [broken][broken] link.

## wrong_link_reference_definition_indent ##

There are [three][] [link][] [reference][] definitions here using the wrong
indent level.

[three]: https://localhost/3
 [link]: https://localhost/link
   [reference]: https://localhost/reference

## wrong_loose_list_spacing ##

This loose list has three entries with the wrong number of blank lines between
it and the previous item:

- OK.

- OK.


- No.
- No!



- 助けて!
